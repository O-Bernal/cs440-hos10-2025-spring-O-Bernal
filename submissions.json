    "description": "Equifax\u2019s consumer-credit web portal was meant to let users dispute credit-report errors. A forgotten, vulnerable Struts component and missing patching process left the portal open to remote-code execution, exposing ~148 million consumer records.",
    "objectives": "1. Timely patch management for all third-party frameworks (< 72 h SLA after CVE release).\r\n2. Hardened configuration & least privilege on all internet-facing portals.\r\n3. Continuous vulnerability scanning to verify that patches and config controls remain in place.",
    "roles": "Security Auditor",
    "standards": "OWASP Guidelines",
    "test_plan": "Weekly authenticated vulnerability scan (N-map + OpenVAS).\r\nQuarterly external pen-test targeting public portals.\r\nVerify CVE-2017-5638 exploit blocked after every build via unit test harness.",
    "defect_management": "All security findings logged in Jira with \u201cSEC-\u201d key, severity S0\u2013S4, 24-h SLA for S0/S1. Fix linked to commit and re-tested before closure.",
    "reviews": "Monthly patch-status audit against NVD list.\r\nQuarterly SQA review of compliance with OWASP and IEEE 730 process clauses.\r\nFindings reported at CISO staff meeting.",
    "supplier_control": "All third-party components tracked in SBOM; suppliers must issue patch notices within 24 h and provide SHA-256 hashes for integrity checks.",
    "references": "United States Government Accountability Office. (2018). DATA PROTECTION actions taken by Equifax and federal agencies in response to the 2017 breach.
